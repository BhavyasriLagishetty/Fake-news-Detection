# Fake-news-Detection
The **Fake News Detection System** is a machine learning project that uses the **Decision Tree algorithm** to identify and classify news as real or fake. This project addresses the pressing issue of misinformation by analyzing textual data and providing accurate predictions.  

The process begins with comprehensive **text preprocessing**, which includes steps like **tokenization** (breaking text into individual words), **stopword removal** (eliminating common but insignificant words), and **vectorization** (converting text into numerical format for machine learning models). These steps ensure that the input data is clean and ready for effective model training.  

The **Decision Tree algorithm** is employed to classify the news, leveraging its ability to handle complex decision-making scenarios. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy** and **precision**, which measure its reliability and correctness in detecting fake news.  

The project is developed using **Python** and leverages powerful libraries like **Scikit-learn** for implementing the machine learning model, **Pandas** for data manipulation, and **NLP tools** for preprocessing and feature extraction.  

By integrating machine learning and natural language processing, this project demonstrates the potential of technology to combat fake news effectively, showcasing expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and text processing techniques.
